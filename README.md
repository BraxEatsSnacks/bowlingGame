# Yung Bowling Game

-- created using **Node.js** --

This is a command line program that functions as a bowling game! 
It will take in the number of pins knocked down on each roll, and prints out a 
neat, formatted score card to your console -- just like the ones at the alley but on a computer 
screen. I even threw in some cool ASCII art! 

(Unforunately, Markdown won't let me show the formatting so I got the next best thing.)

So when running the program it should look something like this:

	 ./bowling 8 1 10 5 5 8 0 10 10 9 1 8 1 9 1 10 7 2

#### See? It's just like real bowling, except without the potential dissapointment!
Bowl with me through the journey of more success, my friend. It's truly lit.

Also, it doesn't have to a complete game but I decided to only tally total score by frame,
because of all of the special rules with spares and strikes so be sure to check that 
out. If you do happen to play a full game and don't want your score card to look 
weird, make sure your terminal is at least **_95 characters_** wide!
