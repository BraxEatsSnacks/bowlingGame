# MustWintern Application -- Bowling Game

-- created using **Node.js** --

This is a command line program that functions as a bowling game! 
It will take in the number of pins knocked down on each roll, and prints out a 
neat, formatted score card -- just like the ones at the alley but on a computer 
screen. I even threw in some cool ASCII art!

So when running the program it should look something like this:

	``` ./bowling 8 1 10 5 5 8 0 10 10 9 1 8 1 9 1 10 7 2 ```

                      ."   ! !   //
                    ."     !    //
                  ."           //
                ."     o      //
              ."             //
            ."              //
          ."               //
        ."      . '.      //
      ."      '     '    //
    ."                  // 
  ."     O             //
         |/
        /|
        / |

#### See? It's just like real bowling, except without the potential dissapointment!
Bowl with me through the journey of more success, my friend. It's truly lit.

Also, it doesn't have to a complete game, so be sure to check that out.
